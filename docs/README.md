# Introduction


In this project you will find 3 folders, `client`, `server` and `webapp`



The client will represent the device application that will send data to the server. The server will capture the data and provide a restful API to utlize the data. The
web app will provide a user interface to see the data and subscribe to each client that posts to the server.


Here is a basic overview diagram of the the system as a whole. Each actor is a system level actor.
