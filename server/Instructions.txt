# Description: Installation instructions for the Eclipse OM2M server
# These instructions are based off of https://os-iot.org/testing-with-a-cse



# OPTION 1 - Run OM2M Server locally on localhost
# Step 1 - Install OM2M
# The instllation files for OM2M 1.0.0 are already included in this repository.
# Version 1.0.0 is based off oneM2M version 1 which is compatible with the current
# release of OS-IoT.
#
# Step 2 - Run oneM2M
bash IN-CSE/start.sh


# OPTION 2 - Build and Run OM2M Server inside a docker container
# These procedures assume an ubuntu host version 18.04
# this option could be especially useful to handle the depenency of OM2M on java 1.7
# Step 1 - Install docker
sudo apt-get install docker -y

# Step 2 - Buikd docker container
# (if desired, edit the Dockerfile first)
sudo docker build -t ser401group6/om2m:1.0.0 -t ser401group6/om2m:latest .

# Step 3 - Run the container containing the OM2M server
run --restart unless-stopped -h om2m -dit -p 8080:8080 --name om2m ser401group6/om2m:latest
